- My program keeps track of the total amount of money that you have in your bank, and you can take any actions such as Deposit or withdrawals. 
- You can click the button to save your transaction history and the other button can display the transaction history. 
- If we want to look at all the transaction history, there is a file that will also contain all of the transaction history and we can look up for any transaction you want. 
- Also, you can convert a random variable from a random currency into the currency that you want by setting the interest rate in the main.
